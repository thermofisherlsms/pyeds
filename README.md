# PyEDS

The *PyEDS* is a Python library providing collection of utilities to conveniently access and display results from Thermo
Discoverer software like *Compound Discoverer* or *Proteome Discoverer*. Although the data are stored in open format
already (SQLite database), reading complex hierarchies is still not a trivial task and requires certain knowledge of
internal mechanisms. Using *PyEDS*, all the hard work is done automatically, so you can focus more on your research
instead of how to read the data.

The *PyEDS* library provides several tools to read data (*pyeds.EDS*), displaying tables metadata (*pyeds.Summary*) as
well as displaying actual data in nicely formatted tables (*pyeds.Review*).

Please see the [examples](https://github.com/thermofisherlsms/pyeds/tree/master/examples) folder to learn more about
available tools and functions.

### Show File Info

```python
import pyeds

# open result file using 'with' statement
with pyeds.Summary("examples/data.cdResult") as summary:
    
    # show full info
    summary.ShowAll()
```

### Reading Individual Tables

```python
import pyeds

# open result file using 'with' statement
with pyeds.EDS("examples/data.cdResult") as eds:
    
    # read top 10 most abundant compounds in specific RT range
    items_iter = eds.Read("Compounds",
        query = "RetentionTime > 3.8 AND RetentionTime < 4.1 AND Name != ''",
        order = "MaxArea",
        desc = True,
        limit = 10)
    
    # print some properties
    for item in items_iter:
        print(item.Name, item.Formula, item.RetentionTime)
```

### Reading Hierarchies

```python
import pyeds

# open result file using 'with' statement
with pyeds.EDS("examples/data.cdResult") as eds:
    
    # define connection path and items to keep
    path = ["Compounds", "BestHitIonInstanceItem", "MassSpectrumInfoItem"]
    keep = ["Compounds", "MassSpectrumInfoItem"]
    
    # limit spectra to MS2 only
    queries = {
        "BestHitIonInstanceItem": "BestHitType = 2",
        "MassSpectrumInfoItem": "MSOrder = 2"}
    
    # read 2 most abundant items only
    orders = {"Compounds": "MaxArea"}
    descs = {"Compounds": True}
    limits = {"Compounds": 2}
    
    # read data
    items_iter = eds.ReadHierarchy(
        path,
        keep = keep,
        queries = queries,
        orders = orders,
        descs = descs,
        limits = limits)
    
    # print some properties
    for item in items_iter:
        
        # print compound properties
        print(item.Name, item.Formula, item.RetentionTime)
        
        # get real spectrum data
        ids = [s.IDs for s in item.Children]
        spectra = eds.ReadMany("MassSpectrumItem", ids)
        
        # print mass spectra
        for spectrum in spectra:
            print("\t", spectrum.Spectrum)
```

### Display Tables

```python
import pyeds

# init tools
eds = pyeds.EDS("examples/data.cdResult")
review = pyeds.Review(eds)

# open result file and review using the 'with' statement
with eds, review:
    
    # read data
    path = ["Compounds", "Compounds per File"]
    items = eds.ReadHierarchy(path,
        limits = {"Compounds": 3},
        orders = {"Compounds": "MaxArea"},
        descs = {"Compounds": True})
    
    # display full hierarchy
    review.InsertItems(items, hierarchy=True, header=True)

# show review
review.Show()
```

## Requirements

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org)
- [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [[RDKit]](https://www.rdkit.org/) (Optional, used to display MOL structures.)
- [[Matplotlib]](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) (Optional, used to display spectra and traces.)


## Installation

The *PyEDS* library is fully implemented in Python. No additional compiler is necessary. After downloading the source
code just run the following command from the folder containing the *setup.py*. Unfortunately there is already a package
with the same name on *pypi.org* therefore we cannot distribute it there.


```$ python setup.py install```

or

```$ pip install .```
